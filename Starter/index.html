<p class= "leadGraph"> Amelia Twyman, a sophomore journalism major at the University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College of Journalism, became interested in the profession because of her high school’s newspaper.</p>

<p>Twyman, originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was able to write a story in high school about the perspectives of non-jewish people following a mass shooting that occurred at a local synagogue. Twyman was able to write this story because her high school newspaper partnered with the city for a project. This experience, she said, inspired her to pursue journalism.</p>

<p>If Twyman could have a superpower, she would want to be a <strong>mindreader</strong> so she could understand other peoples thoughts.</p>

<p>“Knowing what people are thinking [could be useful],” Twyman said.</p> 

<p> The most fun thing she did over winter break was reading, Twyman said. She enjoyed relaxing at home. </p>

<p>She finished reading <a href="https://sarahjmaas.com/throne-of-glass-series/" target="_blank">Throne of Glass</a>, a popular young adult novel series. The books that make up the novel series are long, so it was an accomplishment, according to Twyman. She also finished The Nightingale, which is a bestselling historical fiction novel.</p> 

<p>Twyman’s least favorite vegetable is celery. She despises the vegetable because she feels it “tastes like nothing.” She is also not fond of the vegetable’s “stringy” texture.</p>
